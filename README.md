# 42Cursus-Printf

This project is part of the 42Lisboa curriculum and aims to implement the `printf` function in C. The `printf` function is a widely used function in the C standard library that allows for formatted output printing. It takes a format string as input, which contains format specifiers, flags, and other modifiers, and prints formatted output accordingly.

The main goal of this project is to learn how the `printf` function works and especially to learn how to implement variadic functions in C, which is a fundamental part of how `printf` works.

## Available Format Specifiers

- %c print a single character.
- %s print a string of characters.
- %p The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.
- %d print a decimal (base 10) number.
- %i print an integer in base 10.
- %u print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
- %x print a number in hexadecimal (base 16), with lowercase.
- %X print a number in hexadecimal (base 16), with uppercase.
- %% print a percent sign.
